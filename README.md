# FS-June-3
Hi guys, welcome to the Github repo for our full stack team 3. This repo is just for you to practice using git either individually or collaboratively.

If you want to develop a theme, **DO NOT CLONE FROM THIS REPO!** You should be creating a theme using your own discourse_theme_CLI. 

First, create a branch with your name in this repo. When you want to push your theme, you want to `git add remote` this repo to your local folder first, and then later on you can just commit and push to your branch.
